Sentiment analysis, also referred to as opinion mining, is an approach to natural language processing that identifies the emotional tone behind a body of text. This is a popular way for organizations to determine and categorize opinions about a product, service, or idea. It involves the use of data mining, machine learning and artificial intelligence to mine text for sentiment and subjective information.

In this project, we will try to identify hate and violence speech in a number of tweets using NLP.

I hope you enjoy it.
